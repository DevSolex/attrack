#Am given a weekly allowance of ₦2000. and i am using Python assignment operators to simulate how i spend and manage the money throughout the week.

✅ Instructions:

Am writing a Python program that performs the following steps and prints the allowance after each one:

I spent ₦400 on books.

I found ₦100 under your bed and added it to your allowance.

I bought snacks worth ₦250.

I gave 25% of your current allowance to your younger sibling.

I used one-third of what’s left to buy data.

I split the remaining balance equally between savings and tithing.

Finally,i calculate what remains after removing all complete ₦100 notes using the modulus assignment operator (%=).
